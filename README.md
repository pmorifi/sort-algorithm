## Bubble Sort Algorithm
Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are not in the intended order. Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, each element of the array move to the end in each iteration. Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.

## Quick Sort Algorithm
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort.
